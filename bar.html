		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>The patio at Apothecary offers the best views of Downtown, but the bar serves some of the city’s coolest concoctions.</p> 
		<p>The lounge specializes in seasonal cocktails, and stocks some of the finest liquor and beer in town.</p> 
		<p>Our favorites are some of the Prohibition-era classics on the menu, such as The Pink lady or The Sazerac.</p> 
		<p> But what really sets Apothecary apart is its selection of bitters: Cranberry, Grapefruit, Orange, Blood Orange, Celery, Aztec Chocolate, Rhubarb, classic Old Fashioned and Peychad’s, that can make every cocktail sparkle.</p>
